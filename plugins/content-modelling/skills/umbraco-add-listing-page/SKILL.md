description: >
  Add a listing section to an Umbraco 17+ site: the listing page type, the item page type it
  lists, the listing's own collection view data type and the allowed-children pairing between
  them, with both templates, hung under the right parent. The change is written as a requirements
  doc, approved, applied through the Umbraco Developer MCP or a manual backoffice walkthrough, and
  read back.
  Use this whenever the user asks to "add a blog", "add a news section", "create a listing page",
  "add an events listing", "add an articles section with a list of articles", "set up a list view
  for the news items", or "configure the collection view for this listing".
  SKIP: non-Umbraco projects or Umbraco < 17; one standalone page type (use umbraco-add-page-type);
  non-routable data folders and items such as authors or categories (use umbraco-add-data-folder);
  compositions (use umbraco-add-composition); rendering the list, paging or filtering in Razor or
  C#.

# Add Listing Page

Adds **a listing pair**: a routable listing page (`articleListingPage`) and the routable item it
lists (`articlePage`), made together because neither is useful alone. The listing gets its own
collection view so editors manage items as a table, and the two types allow each other the way
the conventions say. It works requirements-first: write the change down, stop for the user's
approval, apply it, then read it back.

One standalone page belongs to
[`umbraco-add-page-type`](../umbraco-add-page-type/SKILL.md); this skill reuses its decisions for
each of the two pages and adds only what the pairing needs.

The rules come from
[`umbraco-content-model-conventions`](../umbraco-content-model-conventions/SKILL.md), and the
requirements doc format and the six-step workflow from
[`umbraco-content-requirements-documentation`](../umbraco-content-requirements-documentation/SKILL.md)
([change-workflow.md](../umbraco-content-requirements-documentation/references/change-workflow.md));
both must be installed alongside this one. If a link into either cannot be read, stop and say so.

## Steps

| Step | What happens | Reference |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Inspect | Home page, compositions, master template, existing listings and items | [workflow.md](references/workflow.md#1-inspect) |
| 2. Decide the pair | Names, compositions, fields, templates, parent and children | [workflow.md](references/workflow.md#2-decide) |
| 3. Decide the collection view | Columns, ordering, page size, layouts | [collection-view.md](references/collection-view.md) |
| 4. Write and lint | Collection view, two templates, two page types, the parent update, a changeset | [workflow.md](references/workflow.md#3-write-the-requirements-doc) |
| 5. Approve | **Stop.** The user approves the changeset | [workflow.md](references/workflow.md#4-stop-for-approval) |
| 6. Apply | Through the MCP if connected, otherwise a manual walkthrough | [workflow.md](references/workflow.md#5-apply) |
| 7. Verify | Read everything back, set the status lines, report | [workflow.md](references/workflow.md#6-verify-and-report) |

### How to decide between MCP and manual

MCP when connected, otherwise a manual walkthrough from the same requirements doc; see
[change-workflow.md](../umbraco-content-requirements-documentation/references/change-workflow.md#5-apply).

## Version compatibility

Targets **Umbraco 17+**. The collection view uses `Umbraco.ListView` with the editor UI
`Umb.PropertyEditorUi.Collection`, read from the Umbraco 17.5.3 packages. MCP tool names were
checked as described in
[`umbraco-content-requirements-documentation`](../umbraco-content-requirements-documentation/SKILL.md#version-compatibility);
the connected tool list is the authority.

## Best practices

- **Always the pair.** A listing without its item type cannot list anything, and an item type with
  nowhere to live cannot be created. Specify both, and the allowed children between them, in one
  changeset.
- **Name them together**: `<noun>ListingPage` lists `<noun>Page`; see
  [naming.md](../umbraco-content-model-conventions/references/naming.md#suffixes).
- **Each listing has its own collection view**, except listings of the same item type, which may
  share one; see
  [allowed-children-and-root.md](../umbraco-content-model-conventions/references/allowed-children-and-root.md#listings).
- **The listing is not the item's data.** Fields that describe an item (a date, a summary, an
  author) live on the item, or a composition; the listing shows them as columns.
- **Order by something the item holds.** Newest first by a date on the item is usually right; the
  create date is a fallback when the item has none.
- **The parent is an existing type**, updated by a full-body replace: the riskiest call in the
  change, as [`umbraco-add-page-type`](../umbraco-add-page-type/SKILL.md#best-practices) says.
- **"Just add a blog" is a request for the section, not approval** of a requirements doc the user
  has not yet seen; the gate is in
  [change-workflow.md](../umbraco-content-requirements-documentation/references/change-workflow.md#4-stop-for-approval).

## Validation

Objective assertions live in [`evals/evals.json`](evals/evals.json); run them with
`umbraco-skill-evaluator`. Coverage tier: **Documented**. This skill ships no assets; its only
code is the Razor layout stub borrowed from
[`umbraco-add-page-type`](../umbraco-add-page-type/references/workflow.md#5-apply), which is
uncompiled context that no host builds; for real templates see the
[Umbraco templates docs](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/design/templates.md)
or the implementation plugin. The requirements docs it writes are checked by the linter in
`umbraco-content-requirements-documentation`, and an eval graded the guidance. Nothing ran against
a live site.
