# Page kinds

Every routable page is one of four kinds. The kind decides the parent, the allowed children, the
compositions and the icon, so settle it before anything else. The kinds are a lookup, not
alternative approaches: the workflow is the same for all of them.

## Lookup

| | Root | Content | Programmatic | Listing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | The site itself | An everyday page an editor writes | A page whose output is produced by code | A page that lists one item type |
| **Name signals** | Home | About, Contact, Content, Landing, Campaign | Search, Sitemap, Error, Not Found, Login | Blog, News, Events, Articles, "listing", anything plural |
| **Example alias** | `homePage` | `contentPage`, `contactPage` | `searchPage`, `xmlSitemapPage` | `articleListingPage` |
| **Default template** | Yes | Yes | Yes, even though code drives it | Yes |
| **This skill** | Adds it | Adds it | Adds it | **Hands off** to [umbraco-add-listing-page](../../umbraco-add-listing-page/SKILL.md) |

What each kind is allowed at root, which parent allows it and what it allows in turn are in
[allowed-children-and-root.md](../../umbraco-content-model-conventions/references/allowed-children-and-root.md);
its icon and colour in
[icons-and-colours.md](../../umbraco-content-model-conventions/references/icons-and-colours.md);
which compositions it takes in
[compositions.md](../../umbraco-content-model-conventions/references/compositions.md); the
template rule in [templates.md](../../umbraco-content-model-conventions/references/templates.md).
Check any icon name against the site before using it.

## Settling the kind

1. If the name makes the kind obvious (`Home Page`, `Search Page`, `Contact Page`), use it
   without asking.
2. If it is plural or says "listing", "feed" or "archive", it is a listing and a new item type
   together. That is a listing pair: say so and hand off to
   [umbraco-add-listing-page](../../umbraco-add-listing-page/SKILL.md) instead of building half
   of it here.
3. If the user says the page is rendered by a controller, a search index or an API, it is
   programmatic, whatever it is called.
4. Otherwise ask one question and nothing else: "Is this a content page editors write, a
   programmatic page rendered by code (like search), or the site's home page?"

## Kind-specific points

### Root

There is one home page per site. If the site already has one, a second root is almost always a
mistake; ask whether this is a second site (a multi-site install) before adding it. When a home
page is added to a site where other page types are already allowed at root, list them and ask
whether each should become a child of the home page instead. Change nothing about an existing type
without the user's confirmation, because content may already sit at the root.

### Content

The default kind, and the one [minimum-viable-page.md](minimum-viable-page.md) produces. It allows
itself, plus the site's listing page types, so editors can build their own hierarchy and put a
listing inside a section. Most content pages need few or no fields of their own; the page's body
and title usually come from compositions or a block grid.

### Programmatic

Still routable, so still a template: without one the page has a URL that returns nothing. The
controller that renders it (route hijacking or a custom `RenderController`) is code and belongs to
an implementation task, not to this schema change. Say that the controller is still to be written
when you report. Route hijacking finds its controller by the document type alias
(`searchPage` is rendered by `SearchPageController`), so agree the alias with whoever writes the
controller before the requirements doc is approved. A programmatic page allows no children and
takes compositions selectively; a search results page wants SEO fields but rarely a sharing image,
and it may want indexing off.

### Listing

Out of scope here. A listing is only useful with its item type, its own collection view data type
and the allowed-children pairing between them, which
[umbraco-add-listing-page](../../umbraco-add-listing-page/SKILL.md) creates together. If the user
insists on only the listing type, say that it will not be usable until the item type exists.
