# Minimum viable page

When the user asks for "a page type", "a basic page" or "something editors can make pages with"
and says nothing more, propose a **Content Page** instead of asking a list of questions. It is
deliberately small: the right name, place, compositions, template and parent, and two fields.
Everything else is layered on later.

It still goes through the whole [workflow](workflow.md): inspect, write the spec, stop for
approval. The default only saves the decisions.

## The default

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Name and alias | Content Page, `contentPage` |
| Kind | Content ([page-kinds.md](page-kinds.md#content)) |
| Folder | The Document Types root |
| Icon | `icon-document color-light-blue` |
| Description | A general page of text, for anything that is not an article or a listing. |
| Compositions | Every page composition the site already has, such as `seoComposition` |
| Own properties | `pageTitle` (Textstring) and `bodyText` (Richtext editor) on the `Content` tab |
| Template | Content Page, `contentPage.cshtml`, under the master |
| Allowed at root | No |
| Allowed as a child of | The home page, and itself |
| Allowed children | Itself |
| Vary by culture | No, unless the site has more than one language; then ask |

Adjust it to what the inspection found:

| The site has | Change |
|---|---|
| A composition that already gives a page title | Drop `pageTitle` |
| A body block grid data type (for example `Main Content Block Grid`) | Use it as `mainContent` instead of `bodyText` |
| No home page | Ask whether to add one in the same change ([the root question](workflow.md#the-root-question)) |
| No master template | Add a Master template to the change, first |
| No compositions at all | Leave Compositions empty and name the SEO composition as a follow-up for umbraco-add-composition |
| A `contentPage` already | Nothing to add; say so and offer to extend it |

## Worked example

A single-language site with a home page (`homePage`), a master template and an existing
`seoComposition`. The spec folder is `docs/umbraco-schema/`. The home page has no spec page and
is read with the MCP, so its page is written from the read-back as an `Update`; that page is not
shown here.

# Changeset: Content page

> **Status:** proposed

## Summary

Adds a Content Page type and its template, so editors can create general pages under the home
page and under each other. It takes the existing SEO Composition and has a page title and body
text of its own. The Home Page is updated to allow it as a child.

## Specs

| Order | Spec | Kind | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | [Content Page](../Templates/Master/ContentPage.md) | Template | Create |
| 2 | [Content Page](../Document-Types/ContentPage.md) | Document type | Create |
| 3 | [Home Page](../Document-Types/HomePage.md) | Document type | Update |

## Apply checklist

- [ ] 1. Create template `contentPage` under `master`
- [ ] 2. Create document type `contentPage`, then fix-up (sorts, descriptions, template)
- [ ] 3. Set allowed children on `contentPage`: `contentPage`
- [ ] 4. Set allowed children on `homePage`: add `contentPage`, keeping the existing entries
- [ ] 5. Verify every spec against the site and set each status line

## Apply log

—
```

Without the MCP, `HomePage.md` is not written: the Used by line names Home Page as plain text,
row 3 of Specs is dropped, and the summary says the home page was confirmed by the user, not read
from the site.

**Related:** [workflow.md](workflow.md), [page-kinds.md](page-kinds.md).
