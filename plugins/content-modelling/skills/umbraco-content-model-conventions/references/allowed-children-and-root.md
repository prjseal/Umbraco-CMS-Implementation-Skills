# Allowed children and allow-at-root

**Applies to:** the structure settings of every document type.
**Look for:** several page types allowed at root, a listing that allows unrelated types, an item
type that allows children, settings stored on the home page.
**Why:** these two settings decide what an editor can create and where. Loose settings produce a
content tree nobody designed.

## Allowed at root

Only three kinds of type are allowed at root:

| Type | Why it is at root |
|---|---|
| The home page (`homePage`) | It is the site |
| Site settings (`siteSettings`) | One per site, found without walking the tree |
| Data and taxonomy folders (`...Folder`) | Shared data that belongs to no page |

Everything else is created under a parent. If a new page type has no parent yet, add it to the
allowed children of the home page; do not allow it at root to make it creatable.

On an empty site with nothing allowed at root, do not quietly allow a content page at root. Say
that a home page is missing and ask whether to create one.

## Allowed children

| Kind | Allows | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Home page | Content pages, listing pages, programmatic pages | It is the top of the site |
| Content page | Itself, plus listing pages | Editors build their own hierarchy, and a section can contain a listing |
| Listing page | Its item type, plus itself | A listing can be divided into sub-listings of the same kind |
| Item page (`articlePage`) | Nothing | It is a leaf |
| Programmatic page (search, sitemap) | Nothing | It is driven by code |
| Data folder | Its item type, and itself if nesting is wanted | It is a container |
| Data item | Nothing | It is a leaf |
| Site settings | Nothing | It is a singleton |

Set allowed children **last**, after every type in the change exists, because a parent cannot
allow a child that has not been created. Adding a new type usually means editing an existing
parent too; include that parent in the change.

## Listings

A listing page has its own collection view data type, named `<Type> Collection View`, so each
listing can choose its columns and ordering without affecting the others.

## Site settings

Site-wide settings live on a separate root singleton, `siteSettings`: no template, no children,
allowed at root. They do not live on the home page. Keeping them apart means the home page stays
a page, settings can have their own permissions, and the settings node is found by type rather
than by assuming the home page carries it. Its tabs are numbered 0 to 9; see
[tabs-groups-sorts.md](tabs-groups-sorts.md).
